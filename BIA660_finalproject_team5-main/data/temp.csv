"Organization and Job ID Job ID: 312490 Directorate: National Security Division: Computing and Analytics Group: Applied Statistics and Computational Modeling Job Description This position is for an Early Career Data Scientist who will provide scientific and technical research within the National Security Directorate (NSD) supporting the data analytics, mathematics, and applied statistics capabilities of the Computational Analytics Division in the Applied Statistics and Computational Modeling group. Data scientists in the Applied Statistics and Computational Modeling group use statistics, mathematics, and data analysis techniques to develop high quality and defensible methods and tools to address critical scientific challenges in national security, energy, environment, materials sciences, and fundamental sciences. In many cases, our research is deployed across a variety of compute architectures to support big data analytics problems. Examples of our capability areas include: Foundational Mathematics and Statistics: We rely on deep technical expertise in classical statistics, mathematics, and computational modeling to identify, develop, and defend algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific problems. This spans a wide variety of disciplines including experimental design, optimization, uncertainty quantification, signal processing, functional analysis, spatiotemporal modeling, artificial intelligence, machine/deep learning, game theory, graph theory, and Bayesian modeling. Recognizing that no one tool or model can provide the whole solution, we work together to produce innovative solutions that go beyond what we can do ourselves. Domain Science Driven Solutions: We pride ourselves on choosing the right solution for the problem at hand. This is only possible through close partnerships with domain science experts including biologists, chemists, computer vision experts, geospatial analysts, nuclear chemists and engineers, material scientists, environmental scientists, and natural language processors. Our team understands that domain-specific characteristics should steer solutions—we guide experimental design and study planning, data collection, developing methods and executing analyses, reporting results and providing recommendations, and establishing data archival procedures. Our integral role in developing and executing study lifecycles results in explainable, reproducible, and validated research across the entire breadth of laboratory research including problems in critical-infrastructure analysis, classification of multi-omic functionality, environmental planning, nuclear safety and national security. Uncertainty, Risk, and Tradeoffs Analysis: We develop and deploy operational decision-making tools in several domains using model-based and data-driven learning. In doing so, we characterize operations, risk, resilience, and deterrence; incorporate adversarial behavior; and optimize solutions under limited resource constraints. We consider real-world uncertainties around supply chains and concepts of operations, imperfect measurements and observations, human intervention, and external impacts. In the face of these challenges, we provide strategic options and alternatives, quantify confidence in our recommendations to manage risks, and provide effective and achievable solutions that support operational objectives. Deployment to Users : At our core, we are applied researchers and provide results and tools to stakeholders including data scientists, subject matter experts, decision and policy makers. We serve diverse communities and work to communicate effectively by facilitating educational courses, producing high quality papers for peer reviewed publication, and creating user-friendly software tools that can be deployed in a variety of environments. Data science researchers and practitioners work side by side to apply advanced theories, methods, algorithms, models, evaluation tools and testbeds, and computational-based solutions to address complex scientific challenges affecting a wide range of domains and application areas. Core domain knowledge is beneficial, such as in the¿nuclear, biological, energy, materials, or chemical science spaces.¿ The successful candidate will work in interdisciplinary teams to develop and address challenging problems as well as contribute to software solutions, new project ideas, written reports and publications, and technical presentations. Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to work with a diverse team are desired. The hiring level will be determined based on the education, experience and skill set of the successful candidate based on the following: Level I : Expected to contribute professionally, building a professional reputation for technical expertise.
